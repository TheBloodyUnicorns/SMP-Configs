      #
      # Level 1 (1 resident), 5 plots. Cost = (20 * 5) + 0% = 100

      # Level 3 (8 residents), 50 plots. Cost = (20 * 50) + 100% = 2000
      # Level 4 (12 residents), 80 plots. Cost = (20 * 80) + 150% = 4000

nation_siege_immunity:

  # If this setting is true, then nation siege immunity is enabled.
  #
  # This feature gives each nation regular breaks from war,
  # by granting siege-immunity to all their towns after a home-defence war.
  #
  # A home-defence war is a period in which one or more of a nation's towns are under siege.
  #
  # NOTES:
  # 1. To mitigate exploits, nations suffer some mild negative effects while fighting a home-defence war - cannot claim/unclaim/recruit.
  # 2. To mitigate annoyance-sieges, the cost to attack a nation's towns increases as that nation increases in size.
  # 3. If a town switches nation during a home-defence war
  #     then when the home-defence war ends, the post-war immunity from that town,
  #     is distributed between all the nations which the town had during the siege
  #     (but not any occupying nation).
  enabled: 'false'

  # This setting determines the duration of siege immunity which each nation town receives after a home defence war.
  #
  # FORMULA:
  # Nation-Town Immunity Duration = Total Duration of Sieges x This Value.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  # A nation suffers a big home defence war, of 4 sieges, with each siege lasting 3 days.
  # This gives a Total Siege Duration of 12 days
  # If this value is 0.5, then immunity duration will be 6 days
  # Thus when the war ends, each non-besieged nation town will get 6 days of siege immunity.
  duration_modifier: '0.5'

  # If this setting is higher than 0,
  # then the larger a nation is, the higher the cost to attack one of its towns.
  #
  # This setting is important to mitigate 'annoyance sieges',
  # because large nations are disproportionately affected by the mild home defence war restrictions.
  # Thus without mitigation, small nations could attack larger ones,
  # with no intention of fighting, but just to cheaply disrupt them.
  #
  # EXAMPLE:
  # If this setting is 0.1,
  # and an attack is attempted on a nation town,
  # then for every natural town (i.e. not occupied foreign towns) in that nation,
  # the attack-cost (i.e. warchest) requirement is increased by 10% of the amount it would take to attack that town.
  home_town_contribution_to_attack_cost: '0.1'
